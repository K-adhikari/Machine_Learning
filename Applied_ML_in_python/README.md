This repository contains code I wrote for the course 'Applied Machine Learning in Python' in Coursera.

Assignment1.py uses breast cancer data from scikit-learn datasets. The assignment involved loading the data, exploring the features of the dataset, checking instances of malignant and benign cases within the datset, splitting data into training and test sets, fitting a K-nearest neighbor (n_neigbors = 1) classifier to predict the class label of test set, and calculating the accuracy of the knn classifier.
